# GIT

## Workflow

1. On master, pull from origin master
2. Create a feature branch (feature/feature_name)
3. Update your branch with the latest changes from master

   - `git checkout master`
   - `git pull origin master`
   - `git checkout feature/feature_name` (use git branch as needed)
   - `git merge master` (merge master into the feature branch)
   - resolve conflicts and commit changes

4. Push the feature branch to github

   - `git push -u origin feature/feature_name`

      (-u adds an upstream branch so the next time you can type only git push from that branch)

5. Create a pull request on GitHub

   - you should not merge your own pull request

6. checkout to master and pull again from origin master
